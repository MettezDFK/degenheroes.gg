# Questing

* There are 4 primary types of questing, mining, gardening, fishing and foraging.
* Mining and Gardening behave similarly. Fishing and foraging behave similarly. 
* We recommend you start with fishing and foraging because they are simpler to start with and have the cheapest heroes. [Go to our Buying my Hero guide]() for more information on buying your first heroes.
* Don't let your heroes sit idle with full stamina.
* For fishing and foraging, it is fine that you send your heroes for questing after they've reached a minimum of 5 stamina.

## Gardening Quest

* If you have x amount of funds on the gardens, this is the most profitable quest for you.

## Mining Quest

* If you have x amount of locked jewel (present table), this is the most profitable quest for you.
