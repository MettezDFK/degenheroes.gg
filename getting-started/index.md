# Getting Started Guide

Welcome to DeFi Kingdoms, there are a lot of options which may confuse you as to where to start. The aim of this guide is to give you a solid start with the game.

## Heroes to Gardens Ratio

Gardens offer variance free yield, you deposit your funds, you get a big, consistent return. Your deposited capital, remains liquid. There is a penalty if you withdraw in less than a week, but after that time, you can consider your Garden position to be highly liquid. You stake and receive tokens when gardening.

Heroes are a primary mechanism of DFK's play-to-earn model. Heroes collect rewards from quests. Heroes are less liquid than the gardens, in the sense that you have to find a buyer of the heros that you've purchased. A Hero is an NFT with utility, and the rewards are tokens in the form of in-game items.

* Gardens 75%
* Heroes 25%

## Which Garden Should I chose?

All Gardens comprise of two tokens. You would want to deposit to the token pair you want to have long-term exposure to.

* You can chose the crypto blue-chips, which are Jewel-BTC & Jewel-ETH
* Or you can chose the DFK related blue-chips like:
    * Jewel-One
    * Jewel-Avax
    * Jewel-Crystal

## Sell Rewards and Compound

You can hold the rewards, in hope of expectation for additional utility that would raise their price (speculation), but what we recommend when starting out, is that you sell your rewards and compound them:

* Sell your rewards to Vendor Zada, except:
    * Runes: You will need them to level up your heroes.
* Swap your gold for the garden[s] you are in.
* Deposit the exchanged tokens to your garden[s].

Rinse and repeat.
